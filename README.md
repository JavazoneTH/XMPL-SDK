#XMPL SDK    
Welcome to the XMPie XMPL SDK.    

This is the central resource for information about XMPL, the XMPie personalized URL library.    
Using this library you can easily build personalized webpages (PURLs) that are based on XMPie campaigns, with plain HTML tags.   
The technology is built on top of AngularJS and is implemented entirely with client (javascript) code, making it very easy to integrate into your existing website. It is also possible to integrate XMPL with your AngularJS application, and provide advanced functionality.

The XMPie XMPL Server is the server connecting your XMPie campaign with your webpages. The server defines a collection of REST services with which the XMPL library communicates, and makes available for the webpages in form of HTML tags and javascript. The SDK contains information also about the REST services API.
